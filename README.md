## 🚀About me
#### 🏫 I am an Electrical Engineering student at Queensland University Of Technology
#### 🤖 I am currently taking a year off my academic studies to learn more about coding. After 6 months working as an Electrical Engineer Intern in ENTEC A&T, I wanted to learn more about coding. So I decided to take a Machine Learning Engineer Bootcamp  from CoderSchool
#### 🔥 The bootcamp made me fall in love with AI and Data Science and would love to learn and contribute to more projects in Machine Learning.
